# Alias Links: Create Memorable, Branded Short Links

## What are Alias Links?

Alias Links are custom short links that let you create memorable, branded URLs instead of random strings. Turn `seolnk.com/x7k9mq2` into `seolnk.com/summer-sale` or `seolnk.com/signup` - making your links easier to remember, share, and trust.

## Why Use Alias Links?

### 1. **Brand Recognition**
- Use your brand name in every link
- Create consistent naming conventions
- Build trust with recognizable URLs

### 2. **Memorable & Shareable**
- Easy to remember and type manually
- Perfect for verbal sharing (podcasts, videos, presentations)
- Great for print media and offline marketing

### 3. **SEO Benefits**
- Descriptive URLs are better for SEO
- Include keywords in your alias
- Improve click-through rates from search

## How to Create an Alias Link

1. **Enter Destination URL**: The full URL where you want to redirect users
2. **Choose Your Alias**: Pick a custom slug (e.g., "promo2024")
3. **Verify Availability**: Check if your preferred alias is available
4. **Create & Share**: Your branded short link is ready to use

## Use Cases

- **Marketing Campaigns**: `/black-friday`, `/summer-sale`
- **Product Launches**: `/new-product`, `/launch`
- **Resources**: `/pricing`, `/demo`, `/download`
- **Social Media**: `/instagram`, `/youtube`, `/twitter`
- **Events**: `/webinar`, `/conference`, `/meetup`

## Alias Naming Best Practices

✅ Keep it short (5-20 characters)  
✅ Use lowercase letters and hyphens  
✅ Make it descriptive and relevant  
✅ Avoid numbers and special characters when possible  
✅ Consider SEO keywords  
❌ Don't use trademarked terms  
❌ Avoid confusing characters (0 vs O, l vs 1)
