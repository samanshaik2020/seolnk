# Rotator Links: Smart Link Distribution Made Easy

## What are Rotator Links?

Rotator Links (also known as Link Rotators or Round-Robin Links) are intelligent URLs that automatically distribute clicks across multiple destination URLs. One short link, multiple destinations - perfect for A/B testing, load balancing, and maximizing conversions.

## Why Use Rotator Links?

### 1. **A/B Testing Made Simple**
- Test multiple landing pages simultaneously
- Compare performance without complex setups
- Split traffic evenly or use weighted distribution
- Make data-driven decisions

### 2. **Load Distribution**
- Prevent server overload during campaigns
- Distribute affiliate traffic across multiple links
- Balance traffic across multiple stores or regions

### 3. **Maximize Conversions**
- Automatically send traffic to the best-performing destination
- Test different offers, copy, or designs

## How Rotator Links Work

1. **Add Multiple URLs**: Enter 2 or more destination URLs
2. **Set Weights** (Optional): Control traffic distribution percentage
3. **Choose Strategy**: 
   - **Round Robin**: Equal distribution, rotates sequentially
